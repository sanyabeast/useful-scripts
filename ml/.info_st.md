# PyTorch SafeTensors Inspector

This Python script helps you inspect the contents of a PyTorch model saved in SafeTensors format (`.safetensors`). It displays metadata associated with the model and information about each tensor, such as its name, shape, and data type.


**Usage:**

```bash
python inspector.py <safetensors_file_path>
```

* **`<safetensors_file_path>`**: The path to your SafeTensors file containing the PyTorch model. 

**Example:**

```bash
python inspector.py my_model.safetensors
```



This will print detailed information about the contents of `my_model.safetensors`.




**How it Works:**

1. **File Opening:** The script uses the `safe_open` function from the `safetensors` library to open the SafeTensors file in read-only mode. 
2. **Metadata Extraction:** It fetches any metadata associated with the model (if present) and prints it in a readable format. Metadata often includes information about the model architecture, training parameters, or other relevant details.
3. **Tensor Inspection:** The script iterates through each tensor in the SafeTensors file:
   - It retrieves the tensor's name.
   - It gets the tensor's shape (dimensions).
   - It determines the data type of the tensor (e.g., `torch.float32`, `torch.int64`).

   - It prints all this information for each tensor.



**Requirements:**

* Python 3+
* `safetensors` library (`pip install safetensors`)

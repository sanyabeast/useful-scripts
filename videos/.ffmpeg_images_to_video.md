This batch script is designed to automate the process of encoding a sequence of images into a WebM video file using FFmpeg. 

**Here's a breakdown:**

1. **Initialization (`:setup`)**:
   - The `:` followed by `setup` creates a labeled section in the batch script, allowing you to jump to this point later.
   - It uses `@echo off` to suppress displaying individual commands.
   - The script prompts for user input, including:
     -  **Source Directory (`%1`)**: The folder containing your image sequence. 
     - **Frame Files Pattern (`PATTERN`)**: How the images are named (e.g., `0001.png`, `0002.png`). It defaults to `0%%3d.png`.
     - **Target Frames Per Second (`FPS`)**: The desired output video frame rate. Defaults to 30 fps.
     - **Minimum Bitrate (`MINRATE`)** and **Maximum Bitrate (`MAXRATE`)**: Control the video quality and file size. Defaults to 5000 kbps (kilobits per second).

   - The script then prompts for the desired output WebM file name (`OUTPUT`). It defaults to `output.webm`.
   -  It summarizes all entered settings, allowing you to review before proceeding.


2. **Confirmation (`:start`)**:
   - Asks the user for confirmation ("ARE YOU SURE TO START ENCODING?").
   - If the user enters "N" (case-insensitive), it jumps back to the `:setup` section to re-prompt for settings. 
   - If the user enters "Y", it proceeds to the encoding step (`goto :start`).

3. **Encoding Command (`:start`)**:


   - Executes the FFmpeg command to encode the images into a WebM video file.


4. **Pause (`pause`)**:  Pauses the batch script execution, allowing you to see the output before the window closes.



**To Use This Script:**

1. **Save as a .bat file:** Save the code as `encoder.bat` or any other name you prefer.
2. **Open command prompt:** Navigate to the directory containing the `.bat` file using the `cd` command. 3.  **Run the script**: Execute it with the path to your image source folder:

   ```bash
   encoder.bat "C:\path\to\your\image\folder" 
   ```



**Important Notes:**



- **FFmpeg Installation:** Ensure you have FFmpeg installed on your system. The script assumes it's in your system's PATH environment variable.


- **Image Sequence:** Make sure your image files are named consecutively (e.g., `001.png`, `002.png`) or match the pattern specified in the `PATTERN` variable.



This script provides a starting point for automating video encoding from image sequences, and you can customize it further based on your specific requirements.

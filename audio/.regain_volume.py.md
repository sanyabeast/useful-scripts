**Regain Volume**

This Python script amplifies audio files to regain lost volume levels, using the `pydub` library and NumPy.

The script can be used to amplify a single file or an entire folder containing multiple MP3 files. When run with a file path as input, it calculates the current average amplitude of the audio, determines the required gain in decibels (dB) to reach the target average amplitude, amplifies the audio accordingly, and saves the amplified audio to a new file.

When run with a directory path as input, the script processes all MP3 files within that folder and its subfolders. Each file is amplified individually using multiple threads, allowing for faster processing of large collections of files.

**Example Usage**

To amplify a single audio file:
```
python regain_volume.py /path/to/file.mp3
```

To process an entire directory containing multiple MP3 files:
```
python regain_volume.py /path/to/folder/
```

You can also specify additional options:

* `target_avg`: The desired average amplitude of the amplified audio (default: 8000).
* `bitrate`: The bitrate to use when saving the amplified audio (default: "256k").

**Note**

This script assumes that all audio files are in MP3 format. If you want to support other formats as well, you'll need to modify the script accordingly.

Also, keep in mind that this is a simple volume measurement and amplification tool, and may not provide accurate results for all types of audio content.

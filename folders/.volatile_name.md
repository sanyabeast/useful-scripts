# Volatile Directory Name Renamer

This script renames all folders within a specified directory that start with a given prefix to new unique names.  

**Usage:**

```bash
python volatile_dir_name.py <directory_path> <name_prefix>
```

* **`<directory_path>`**: The path to the directory containing the folders you want to rename.
* **`<name_prefix>`**: The common prefix of the folders you want to rename. 

**Example:**

```bash
python volatile_dir_name.py /path/to/my/folders temp
```
This will rename all folders in `/path/to/my/folders` that begin with "temp" to unique names while preserving the prefix.


**How it Works:**

1. The script identifies all folders within the specified directory using `os.listdir`.
2. It filters these folders based on the provided `name_prefix`.
3. For each matching folder, it generates a new name:
   -  It starts with the `name_prefix` followed by a random number between 1 and 9,999,999 to ensure uniqueness.
4. It checks if the generated name already exists in the directory. If it does, it generates another unique name until a valid one is found.
5. Finally, it renames the folder using `os.rename`.

**Note:**


* The script assumes that you only want to rename folders and not files.

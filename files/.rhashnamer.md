# Random File Renamer

This script renames all files within a specified directory to random alphanumeric strings while preserving their original extensions. 

**Usage:**

```bash
python random_file_renamer.py <directory_path> <length>
```

* **`<directory_path>`**: The path to the directory containing the files you want to rename.
* **`<length>`**: The desired length of the new file names (number of characters).

**Example:**

```bash
python random_file_renamer.py /path/to/my/files 12
```
This will rename all files in `/path/to/my/files` to random 12-character alphanumeric strings.

**How it Works:**

1. The script iterates through each file in the specified directory and its subdirectories.
2. For each file, it generates a random string of the specified length using `random.choices`.
3. It combines this random string with the original file extension to create a new filename. 
4. Finally, it renames the file using `os.rename()`.

**Note:**

- The script overwrites existing files with the same name in the target directory.

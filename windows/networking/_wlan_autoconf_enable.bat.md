Enable Wi-Fi Autoconfiguration Script (Windows)

This batch script enables the automatic configuration of your Windows Wi-Fi adapter. This can be useful if you want to allow your computer to automatically connect to nearby networks or configure network settings.

**How it Works**

1. Run the script by double-clicking on `wlan_autoconf_enable.bat`.
2. The script will check for administrative permissions and request them if necessary.
3. Once granted, the script will use the Windows command-line utility `netsh` to enable Wi-Fi autoconfiguration.

**Prerequisites**

* This script is designed for Windows operating systems only.
* You must have administrative privileges on your computer to run this script successfully.

That's it!

## Midjourney Image Splitter

A Python script to split square images generated by Midjourney into four smaller, square images.

This script is designed specifically for processing images from the AI art generator Midjourney. It divides square images into quadrants and saves them as separate files, removing the original image in the process.

**Note:** This script *only* works on square images. Non-square images are ignored.

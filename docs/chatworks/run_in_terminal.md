# run_in_terminal.sh

**README for `run_in_terminal.sh`**

This document provides information about the `run_in_terminal.sh` script, including its purpose, functionality, usage instructions, and limitations.

## Overview

The `run_in_terminal.sh` script launches a new terminal window using a specified terminal emulator and executes a given command within that terminal.  The terminal window is automatically closed after the command completes, prompting the user to press any key to exit. This is useful for running scripts or commands in a clean, isolated environment without leaving lingering terminals open.

## Main Components & Logic

The script performs the following actions:

1. **Argument Validation:** Checks if at least two arguments are provided (terminal emulator and command). If not, it displays usage instructions and exits with an error code.
2. **Title Handling:**  If a third argument is provided, it's used as the terminal window title. Otherwise, a default title of "terminal" is assigned.
3. **Timestamp Generation:** Generates a timestamp using `date` in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
4. **Terminal Title Construction:** Combines the provided (or default) title with the generated timestamp to create a descriptive terminal window title.
5. **Command Execution:** Executes the specified terminal emulator with arguments that:
   * `-T`: Sets the terminal title.
   * `-e`:  Executes a command within the new terminal. The command is `bash -c '...'` which allows us to execute a complex command string, including pausing for user input.
   * The inner `bash -c` executes the provided command (`$2`) and then pauses execution using `read -n1 -r -p

## colorize_with_fixed_palette.py - Image Color Adjustment Script

This script modifies an image by adding a fixed red, green, and blue value to each pixel's color channels. It uses the Pillow (PIL) library for image manipulation.

The script is designed for simple color adjustments where you want to shift all colors in an image by a constant amount.  It clamps the resulting RGB values between 0 and 255 to prevent overflow or underflow, ensuring valid pixel colors.

**Note:** The filename `abracadabra` added to the output file name is hardcoded and cannot be changed directly within the script without modification.

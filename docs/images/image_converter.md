# image_converter.py

## Image Converter Script

This script converts images from one format to another within a specified directory and its subdirectories.
It also calculates and prints the total size before and after conversion, as well as the space saved. The original files are deleted after successful conversion.

**Note:** This script requires the Pillow (PIL) library to be installed. See 'Requirements' below for details.

# to_gguf.py

Converts a safetensors file to the GGUF format for use with compatible language models (e.g., llama.cpp).  This script provides basic functionality and is intended as a starting point; full GGUF compliance requires more extensive implementation, especially regarding metadata and tensor type handling.

**Warning:** This script contains mock quantization logic. It does *not* perform proper quantization and should be replaced with a robust quantization solution for production use.

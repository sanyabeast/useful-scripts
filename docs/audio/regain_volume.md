## regain_volume.py - Audio Volume Enhancement Script

This script automatically increases the volume of MP3 audio files or folders containing them, aiming to bring their average amplitude closer to a target value.

**Note:** This script requires `pydub` and `numpy` libraries to be installed (see 'Requirements' below).  It also assumes that the input file is an MP3. Other formats will likely cause errors.

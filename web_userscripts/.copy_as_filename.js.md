This is a UserScript written in JavaScript, specifically designed for use with the Greasemonkey extension (a Firefox add-on). It's intended to be used on web pages that allow user selection of text.

Here's what this script does:

1. **Copies selected text as sanitized filename**: The `copySelectedAsFilename()` function gets the currently selected text, sanitizes it by removing disallowed characters (`<>:"\/\\|?*\x00-\x1F`), and then copies the resulting string to the clipboard using Greasemonkey's built-in `GM_ setClipboard()` method.
2. **Registers a menu command**: The script registers a new menu item called "Copy Field Name" (or something similar) that, when clicked, will execute the `copySelectedAsFilename()` function.
3. **Captures Ctrl+Alt+C shortcut**: The script also listens for keydown events and captures the combination of keys: Ctrl + Alt + C. When this combination is pressed, it calls the `copySelectedAsFilename()` function to copy the selected text as a sanitized filename.

The script uses Greasemonkey's API (Application Programming Interface) methods:

* `GM_ registerMenuCommand()`: Registers a new menu item.
* `GM_setClipboard()`: Sets the clipboard contents.

This UserScript is designed for use on web pages that allow user selection of text, and it provides an easy way to copy selected text as a sanitized filename (e.g., without special characters) using either the menu command or the Ctrl+Alt+C shortcut.

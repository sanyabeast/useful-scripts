# Image Renamer with Hexadecimal Prefixes

This script renames all image files (JPG and PNG) in a given folder using a unique hexadecimal prefix based on their order. You can also choose to shuffle the images before renaming for random ordering.

**Usage:**

```bash
python rename_images_hex.py <folder_path> [shuffle]
```

* **`<folder_path>`**: The path to the directory containing your image files.
* **`[shuffle]`**: (Optional) Set to "shuffle" if you want to randomly reorder images before renaming (defaults to False - maintains original order).

**Example:**

```bash
python rename_images_hex.py /path/to/my/images 
```
This will rename all JPG and PNG files in `/path/to/my/images` sequentially with hexadecimal prefixes starting from "1", "2", "3", etc.


*  **Example with shuffling:**

```bash
python rename_images_hex.py /path/to/my/images shuffle
```
This will shuffle the image order and then apply the hexadecimal naming scheme.



**How it Works:**

1. **Finds Images:** The script locates all JPG and PNG files within the specified directory.
2. **Optional Shuffling:** If `shuffle` is set to "shuffle", the list of images is randomly reordered. Otherwise, the files are sorted alphabetically by name (preserving order).
3. **Temporary Rename:** Each image file is temporarily renamed with a unique UUID followed by its original extension, creating temporary filenames. This allows renaming without overwriting existing files during the process.
4. **Hexadecimal Naming:** The script assigns a hexadecimal number to each image based on its index in the list (starting from "1"). 
5. **Final Rename:**  It renames each temporary file using the generated hexadecimal prefix and the original extension, creating the final unique filenames.

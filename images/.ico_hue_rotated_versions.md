##  ICO Hue Rotator 

This script rotates the hue of an ICO file image by specified steps, creating variations with different color shades.


### Usage

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python installed along with the Pillow (PIL) library. You can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pillow numpy
   ```

2. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python script.py <ico_image_path> <step>
   ```

   * `<ico_image_path>`: The path to the ICO file you want to process.
   * `<step>`:  The angle in degrees by which to rotate the hue for each variation (e.g., 15, 30, 45).

**Example:**
```bash
python script.py my_icon.ico 30
```
This will process `my_icon.ico` creating variations with hue rotations in increments of 30 degrees.

### How it Works

* **Load ICO file:** The script opens the provided ICO file using Pillow's `Image.open()` function.

* **Extract Frames:** It extracts all frames from the ICO file and determines the largest frame size.
* **Hue Rotation:**  The `apply_hue_rotation()` function applies hue rotation to each frame using OpenCV's color space conversion and arithmetic operations.
* **Save Variations:** The rotated frames are saved as new ICO files with names indicating the hue angle applied.

### Notes:


* Only `.ico` files are supported.
* The script creates new files with modified hues, leaving the original file unchanged.

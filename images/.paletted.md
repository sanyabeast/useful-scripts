# Image Palette Generator

This script takes an input image and reduces its color palette to a specified number of colors using Floyd-Steinberg dithering, a technique that simulates more colors with fewer. It also allows pixelation for a retro art style.

**Usage:**

```bash
python palette.py <input_image> [<num_colors>] [<pixelation_level>] 
```

* **`<input_image>`**:  The path to the image file you want to process.
* **`[<num_colors>]`**: The desired number of colors in the palette (default is 8).
* **`[<pixelation_level>]`**:  The level of pixelation (default is 4). A higher number results in more noticeable pixelation.

**Example:**

```bash
python palette.py my_image.jpg 16 8
```


This will:
- Process the image `my_image.jpg`.
- Reduce its color palette to 16 colors.
- Apply pixelation with a level of 8.

 **Output:**

The script saves the output image with a modified filename that includes the number of colors used (e.g., `my_image_16colors.png`).



**How it Works:**

1. **Image Loading:** The script loads the input image using the Pillow (PIL) library.
2. **Pixelation:** It applies pixelation by resizing the image to a smaller size and then back to its original dimensions, effectively "pixelating" the details. This is done with `resize` method and different resampling options (`Image.BOX` for initial downsampling, `Image.NEAREST` for upscaling).

3. **Palette Reduction:**  It converts the pixelated image to a palette using `convert('P', palette=Image.ADAPTIVE, colors=num_colors)`. This uses Floyd-Steinberg dithering to create the illusion of more colors while reducing the actual color count.
4. **Saving:** The script saves the resulting image with the new filename indicating the number of colors used in the palette.




**Requirements:**

* You'll need the Pillow (PIL) library installed. You can install it using pip: `pip install pillow`.

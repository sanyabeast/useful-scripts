# Image Resizer

This script resizes all PNG images within a specified folder to a maximum size specified by the user. 

**Usage:**

```bash
python resize_images.py <folder_path> <max_size>
```

* **`<folder_path>`**: The path to the directory containing the PNG image files you want to resize.
* **`<max_size>`**:  The maximum width and height (in pixels) for the resized images.


**Example:**

```bash
python resize_images.py /path/to/my/images 500
```
This will resize all PNG images in `/path/to/my/images` to a maximum dimension of 500 pixels.



**How it Works:**

1. **File Iteration:** The script iterates through each file in the specified folder using `os.listdir`.
2. **PNG Check:** It checks if the filename ends with ".png" to process only PNG images.
3. **Image Loading:**  It uses the Pillow (PIL) library to open each image file.
4. **Resizing:** The script uses `image.thumbnail((max_size, max_size), Image.ANTIALIAS)` to resize the image while preserving its aspect ratio.
5. **Saving:** It saves the resized image back to the original file path.
6. **Error Handling:** A `try...except` block handles potential errors during image loading or saving.

**Requirements:**


* You'll need the Pillow (PIL) library installed. You can install it using pip: `pip install pillow`.
